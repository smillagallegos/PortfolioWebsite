# PortfolioWebsite

This website was created to showcase my data projects in a clear and professional way. It serves as a central hub where potential employers, collaborators, and peers can explore my work, learn about my background, and view interactive dashboards and case studies.  

The site was built with a focus on simplicity, readability, and accessibility, ensuring that each project is presented with enough context to highlight both the technical process and the business insights behind it. It is hosted via **GitHub Pages** and will continue to evolve as I expand my portfolio with new projects and case studies.
