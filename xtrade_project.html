            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project was developed as part of a business case scenario included in the <em>Máster en Power BI</em> course by <em>Daxus Latam</em>. 
                I enrolled in this program to deepen my mastery of Power BI and strengthen my skills in business data analysis. 
                The business case challenges students to analyze B2B sales data for a fictional company, originally named XSales. I rebranded the company as 
                <strong><em>XTrade</em></strong> and designed a custom business-oriented logo to create a visual identity for this company and create a more 
                realistic executive dashboard experience. While the business context and dataset were provided as part of the case, I completed the entire 
                analysis independently, from structuring the problem and exploring the data in Excel to designing and developing the Power BI dashboard and later 
                reviewed my solution against the course walkthrough to validate and refine my approach.

            <h2>Data Source</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset was sourced from the Power BI course <em>Máster en Power BI</em> course by <em>Daxus Latam</em>. The dataset contains fictional B2B sales 
                transactions on sales, costs, discounts, and profit margins for multiple products across different countries and customer types.

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Excel:</strong> Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns before dashboard development.</li>
            <li><strong>Power BI:</strong> Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize sales KPIs and support decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>PowerPoint:</strong> Used to design the dashboard background templates and enhance the visual layout.</li>

            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
            <p>
            Before building the dashboard, I performed an exploratory analysis of the dataset in <strong><em>Excel</em></strong>. My goal was to understand the purpose and meaning of each feature, assess the quality and consistency of the data, 
            and identify any issues such as missing values, inconsistent formats, or irrelevant columns. This step helped me clarify what business questions I wanted to answer, what metrics would be meaningful, and how 
            to best present them, not just in terms of content, but also by selecting the most appropriate chart types for each type of data. By doing so, I ensured that the dashboard would not only be accurate and 
            informative, but also intuitive and visually effective for the end user.

            <h2>Excel Reporting</h2>
            <p>
                Before building the dashboard, I conducted a thorough exploratory analysis in Excel to understand the dataset and develop a comprehensive report addressing business-oriented questions from the case scenario, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Did the company generate a profit or loss during the period?</li>
                <li>What is the average monthly revenue?</li>
                <li>Which month had the highest revenue?</li>
                <li>What was the total amount of sales discounts during the period?</li>
                <li>Which country had the highest profit margin?</li>
                <li>Which country generated the highest total revenue?</li>
                <li>Which customer contributed the highest revenue?</li>
                <li>Which customer type yielded the highest profit margin?</li>
                <li>Did any product result in a loss during the analysis period?</li>
                <li>What is the total revenue and profit margin for each product?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To strengthen my proficiency in Excel for building reports and performing calculations, I built the report using two different approaches: <strong><em>traditional Excel formulas</em></strong> and <strong><em>Pivot Tables</em></strong>, applying key calculations and conditional formatting in both to highlight insights and trends effectively.

            <h2>Power BI Dashboard</h2>
            <p>
                The final dashboard provides comprehensive insights into sales performance across products, countries, and customer types:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Revenue Trends Over Time</strong>
                <p>Shows net revenue by month across two years (2022-2023), with a reference line for average revenue, helping to identify high and low-performing periods.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Product-Level Performance Table</strong>
                <p>Displays sales, discounts, costs, profit, and profit margin for each product for quick comparison.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Revenue by Country and Customer Type</strong>
                <p>Shows which regions and customer segments generate the most revenue, making it easy to assess market distribution.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Profit Margin by Country and Customer Type</strong>
                <p>Visualizes profitability per region and client type. Conditional formatting emphasizes negative margins (in red) for rapid identification of losses.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Key Metrics Cards</strong>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Filter</strong>
                <p>Users can dynamically filter the dashboard by year (2022 or 2023) using slicer buttons for focused, year-over-year analysis.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Dashboard Template & Visual Design</h2>
            <p>
            To give the dashboard a polished, user-friendly look, I created custom layout templates in <strong><em>PowerPoint</em></strong> that serve as visual backdrops for the dashboard. 
            I wanted to inject my own style into the project and show my interest in user-centred design by beginning to explore concepts like colour psychology and 
            layout hierarchy. This creative process allowed me to bring both analytical insight and visual clarity to the final presentation to better engage the final viewer.
